**Note:** ‚ö†Ô∏èThe source code provided in this repository is for the training of the model described in the accompanying paper. Please note the following:

1. The paper associated with this code has not been accepted or published yet. Therefore, the current code only includes the model training code and not the final trained model or optimized hyperparameters.
2. The network's hyperparameters are randomly initialized and have not undergone any training.
3. Once the paper is accepted and published, the authors will update this repository with the trained model and the final hyperparameters, which will be accessible through the original GitHub link provided.
4. Until then, this repository serves as a reference for the code used in the model training process, and it does not contain any conclusive or publishable results.
